Kokkos has support for lightweight task-based programming, which is currently pretty limited but we plan to substantially expand in the future.

Will Kokkos Tasking work for my problem?
========================================

Not all task-based problems are a good fit for the current Kokkos approach to tasking.  Currently, the tasking interface in Kokkos is  targetted at problems with kernels far too small to overcome the inherent overhead of top-level Kokkos data parallel launchesâ€”that is, small but plentiful data parallel tasks with a non-trivial dependency structure.  For tasks that fit this general scale model but have (very) trivial dependency structures, it may be easier to use [hierarchical parallelism](HierarchicalParallelism), potentially with a `Kokkos::Schedule<Dynamic>` scheduling policy (see, for instance, [this page](Kokkos%3A%3ARangePolicy)) for load balancing if necessary. 

Basic Usage
===========

Fundamentally, task parallelism is just another form of parallelism in Kokkos.  The same general idiom of pattern, policy, and functor applies as for ordinary [parallel dispatch](ParallelDispatch):

Similarly, for tasking, we have:

Task Functor
------------

In most ways, the functor portion of the task parallelism idiom in Kokkos is similar to that for data parallelism.  Task functors haeve the additional requirement that the task output type needs to be provided by the user by giving a nested type (a.k.a. "typedef") named `value_type`:

```c++
struct MyTask {
  using value_type = double;
  template <class TeamMember>
  KOKKOS_INLINE_FUNCTION
  void operator()(TeamMember& member, double& result);
};
```

Similar to [team parallelism](HierarchicalParallelism), the first parameter is the team handle, which has all of the same functionality as the one produced by a `Kokkos::TeamPolicy`, with a few extras.  Like with `Kokkos::parallel_reduce()`, the output is expressed through the second parameter.  Note that there is currently no lambda interface to Kokkos Tasking.

Task Patterns
-------------

The primary analogs of `Kokkos::parallel_for()` and friends for tasking are `Kokkos::task_spawn()` and `Kokkos::host_spawn()`.  They both return a `Kokkos::Future` associated with the appropriate `Scheduler`, but `host_spawn` can only be called from *outside* of a task functor, while `task_spawn` can only be called from *inside* of one.

Task Policies
-------------

There are currently two task policies in Kokkos Tasking: `TaskSingle` and `TaskTeam`.  The former tells Kokkos to launch the associated task functor with a single worker when its predecessors are done (more on this below), while the latter tells Kokkos to launch with a team of workers, similar to a single team from a `Kokkos::TeamPolicy` launch in data parallelism.

Predecessors
------------

Dependency relationships in Kokkos are represented by instances of the `Kokkos::Future` class template.
