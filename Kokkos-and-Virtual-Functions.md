# Chapter 13

# Kokkos and Virtual Functions

This is currently a placeholder; please reference @crtrott comment on pull request #21. (Virtual functions are technically allowed, but calling them is subject to restrictions described elsewhere. And we then need to add a chapter about the advanced topic: Kokkos and Virtual Function calls.)

This needs to be developed.
