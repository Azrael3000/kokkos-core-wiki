# Kokkos::Vector

The Kokkos Vector is semantically similar to the std::vector, but it is designed to overcome issues with memory allocations and copies when working with devices that have different memory spaces.  The Kokkos::Vector is a Rank-1 DualView that implements the same interface as the std::vector.  This allows programs that rely heavily on std::vector to grant access to program data from within a non-host execution space.  Note that many of the std::vector compatible functions are host only, so access may be limited based on kernel complexity.  Below is a synopsis of the class and the description for each method specifies whether it is supported on the host, device or both.
